Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Answer: as far as Java is concerned, everything is strictly Pass by Value.

Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Answer: the value of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD is the references to their corresponding object.
	Since Java is pass-by-value, when we pass jungleDVD and cinderella to swap(), 
	the function swap() creates two copies of value of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, 
	we will name them o1 and o2 and implement function on them.
	Anything you do on o1 and o2 will not affect jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. 
	Therefore, two objects remain unchange.

Question: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Answer: In this method, when we pass the "dvd" to the function changeTitle. 
	This function will work on a copy version "dvd1" of "dvd", 
	which have the same value as "dvd" ( the value mentioned here is the reference to the object DigitialVideoDisc). 
	Therefore, when we write dvd.setTitle(title) or dvd1.setTitle() since we work on a copy), 
	it still point to the same object that "dvd" point to to implement the method setter and change the its title eventually.
